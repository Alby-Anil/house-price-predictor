"# Real Estate Price Predictor" 
"## Features" 
"- Preprocessing and cleaning housing data" 
"- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations" 
"- Machine learning model training" 
"- Price predictions based on input features" 
"## Installation & Setup" 
"1. Clone the repository:" 
"   \`\`\`bash" 
"   git clone https://github.com/Alby-Anil/house-price-predictor.git" 
"   \`\`\`" 
"2. Navigate to the project folder:" 
"   \`\`\`bash" 
"   cd house-price-predictor" 
"   \`\`\`" 
"3. Install dependencies:" 
"   \`\`\`bash" 
"   pip install -r requirements.txt" 
"   \`\`\`" 
"4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the project." 
"## Dataset" 
"This project uses a housing dataset (`housing.csv`) containing features such as:" 
"- Median income" 
"- House age" 
"- Number of rooms" 
"- Latitude & Longitude" 
"These features are used to predict house prices using a machine learning model." 
"## How to Use" 
"1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`house-price-predictor.ipynb`)." 
"2. Load the dataset (`housing.csv`)." 
"3. Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data." 
"4. Train the machine learning model using scikit-learn." 
"5. Use the trained model to predict house prices based on user inputs." 
"6. Visualize and interpret results with data plots." 
"## Future Improvements" 
"- Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning." 
"- Expand the dataset to include more location-based features." 
"- Implement a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit or Flask." 
"- Add real-time data integration for more accurate predictions." 
"- Improve visualization with interactive graphs and dashboards."
