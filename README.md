# 🏠 Real Estate Price Predictor

## 📌 Overview
This machine learning project predicts housing prices based on attributes like median income, housing age, geographical location, and more. It serves as a practical exploration of regression techniques, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and end-to-end data science workflow.

## 🔧 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis with informative plots  
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest Regression  
- Interactive prediction by modifying input features  
- Clean and modular Jupyter Notebook implementation

## 📂 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alby-Anil/house-price-predictor.git

2- Navigate to the project directory:
cd house-price-predictor

3- Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4- Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook house-price-predictor.ipynb

📊 Dataset
This project uses the housing.csv dataset with features like:
- Median income
- Housing median age
- Total rooms and bedrooms
- Population and households
- Latitude and Longitude
These features power the price prediction model.

🚀 Usage
- Open the notebook
- Run all cells in sequence
- Modify input parameters to predict median house values
- Visualize trends and insights from model output

🌱 Future Work
- Add model validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Integrate geospatial features for richer predictions
- Build a simple UI (e.g., CLI or Streamlit)
- Include interactive data visualizations
